# Predictive Analysis of Song Popularity on Spotify

## **Introduction**

Welcome to this notebook showcasing a sophisticated predictive analysis of song popularity on the Spotify platform. In this project, we venture into the dynamic intersection of data science and the music industry, where insights into song success can be a game-changer for artists, labels, and streaming services.



### **Problem Definition**

The project is poised to address a critical challenge: crafting a robust predictive model that accurately anticipates the popularity of songs. By accomplishing this, it aims to empower music industry stakeholders with actionable intelligence for optimizing marketing strategies, fine-tuning playlists, and catalyzing artist visibility.



### **Dataset**

I have obtained a comprehensive dataset from Spotify (Scraped directly from Spotify Web  API & from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/song-popularity-dataset), containing information about a diverse range of songs. This dataset includes features such as artist name, genre, danceability, tempo, and more. By harnessing the power of machine learning, we will uncover patterns and relationships within this data to build a model that predicts song popularity. **I've made sure to use an old spotify dataset from kaggle as per Spotify Web Dev Policy**



### **Project Roadmap**

This project will be structured into three main key phases:

1. Understanding Data
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Model Building & Prediction

Let's embark on this data-driven journey to unlock the secrets behind song popularity and revolutionize how the music industry approaches success!
